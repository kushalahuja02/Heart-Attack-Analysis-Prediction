# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
This project employs various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart attacks using a dataset with heart-related attributes. The goal is to determine which models and techniques best predict heart attack occurrence.

## Research Question
Can we predict the occurrence of heart disease using specific features in the dataset?

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 14 attributes, including age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and ST depression induced by exercise.

## Models and Approach
- **Logistic Regression**: Primary model with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Accuracy: 89%.
- **Decision Tree**: Implemented for interpretability. Accuracy: 84%.
- **Naive Bayes**: Efficient for large datasets. Accuracies: 87% and 89%.
- **Random Forest**: Handles class imbalances and feature importance. Accuracy: 85% to 89%.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Various kernel functions. Accuracy: 85% to 87%.

## Performance Metrics
- Models evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.

## Comparative Analysis
- Best models: Naive Bayes Model 2, Random Forest Model 2, and Logistic Regression Model 3 (89% accuracy each).
- Feature scaling, kernel choice in SVM, and hyperparameter tuning were crucial.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
- The study underscores the potential of machine learning in predicting heart disease.
- Model selection should be based on the use case, interpretability, computational resources, and more.
- Recommended models for different scenarios: Random Forest 2, Naive Bayes 2, and Logistic Regression 3.

## Future Work
- Exploration of different feature selection techniques and more complex models, including deep learning.
- Expansion of the dataset to enhance performance and generalizability.
- Continuous updates and validation of the models with new data.

## Ethical Considerations
- The project adheres to data privacy standards and ethical practices, using a public dataset for health awareness.

## How to Use
- After opening the notebook, you can run each cell to see the analysis performed on the heart dataset. The notebook is designed to guide you through the analysis step by step.
